Hey there! I'm Aryan, a passionate coder and nature enthusiast, Thanks for stopping by!

## About Me

I've been fascinated by computers since childhood, and the thrill of telling them what to do through programming has always been exhilarating for me. I've been honing my coding skills since a young age.

## Memorable Programming Moment

One of my most memorable moments in programming was when I participated in the 48-hour NASA SpaceApps hackathon. We had to build a website and a 3D model, which pushed me out of my comfort zone to learn backend development within a short timeframe. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience.

## Other Interests

When I'm not coding, you can often find me exploring the great outdoors with my camera in hand, capturing the beauty of wildlife and nature through photography.
